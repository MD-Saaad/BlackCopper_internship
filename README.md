# BlackCopper Data Science Project

This repository contains the code for a data science project developed for the BlackCopper assignment. The project involves scraping data from a given Excel file containing various website URLs. The goal is to extract the title and summary of articles from these websites and store the information in a new text file.

## Project Overview

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. The following Python libraries are used:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling the Excel file.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch HTML content from the websites.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and extracting information from web pages.

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- **`data/`**: This directory contains the input Excel file with website URLs.
- **`notebooks/`**: The Jupyter Notebook file (`data_scraping.ipynb`) contains the code for scraping data.
- **`output/`**: The extracted information is stored in a new text file (`output.txt`).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackcopper-data-science.git

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash 
   pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4
   Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (notebooks/data_scraping.ipynb) to execute the data scraping code.
   



Check the output/ directory for the generated text file (output.txt) containing the extracted information.

## Dependencies
- **`Python 3.x`**.
- **`Pandas`**.
- **`Requests.`**
- **`BeautifulSoup.`**
